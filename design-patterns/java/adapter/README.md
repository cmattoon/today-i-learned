Adapter Design Pattern
----------------------
* Allows 2 incompatable interfaces to work together
* Used when client expects a target interface
* The adapter class allows the use of the available interface and the Target interface.
* Any class can work together as long as the Adapter solves the issue that all classes must implement every metnod defined by the shared interface.
