Template Method Design Pattern
------------------------------
 * Used to create a group of subclasses that have to execute a similar group of methods
 * You create an abstract class that contains a method called the Template Method
 * The Template Method contains a series of method calls that every subclass object will call
 * The subclass objects can override some of the method calls.
 * aka Inheritance/Overriding?
