Bridge Design Pattern
---------------------
 * Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently
 * To progressively add functionality while separating out major differences with abstract classes

Use Cases:
 * When you want to be able to change both abstractions and concrete classes independently
 * When you want the first abstract class to define rules
 * The concrete class adds additional rules
